VGdb is a perl program that allows the use of vim as a front end to gdb. It
both works on MS Windows and Linux. It both works in gvim and vim.

It open a vgdb window in vim that allows user to type gdb command
directly, and gdb output is redirected to this windows. 

MSVC-style shortcuts are defined by default, and MSVC autoexp.dat is partially supported.

A flash demo (__VGDB_DEMO__.htm) in my package helps you quickly go through the
vgdb features.
